# Introduction to Yi-Coder
Yi Coder is a suite of advanced code language models, meticulously trained from the ground up on a dataset of 3 trillion tokens, with 2 trillion specifically dedicated to code. We offer two model sizes: 1.5B and 9B parameters. Each model is pre-trained on a project-level code corpus utilizing a 128K token context window and an additional fill-in-the-blank task. Yi Coder supports a wide range of functions, including code completion, generation, interpretation, web search, and repository-level code Q&A, catering to various software development scenarios. Yi Coder has demonstrated highly competitive performance on public benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and HumanEval.

## Highlights：
- **Powerful Coding Performance**: Yi Coder excels in models with less than 10 billion parameters, achieving performance on par with DeepSeek-Coder 33B and Qwen Coder 7B, delivering outstanding code generation capabilities.
- **Support Long Context Window**: Yi Coder supports a long context window of up to 128K tokens, with a custom "needle-in-the-code" feature that consistently delivers excellent, fully green results in testing.

# News
🔥 **2024-09-04**: The Yi-Coder model is open sourced and available to the public.
