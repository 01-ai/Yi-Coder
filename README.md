# Introduction to Yi-Coder
Yi-Coder series models are trained for coding tasks and deliver state-of-the-art coding performance among models under 10 billion parameters. With two model sizes (1.5B and 9B) available in both base and chat versions, Yi-Coder series models support 52 coding languages, which are powerful tools for developers.
## Key featuresï¼š
- **Long-Context Capability**: Yi Coder series models excel in long-context understanding, handling up to 128K tokens and enabling project-level code comprehension and generation.
- **Small but mighty**: Yi-Coder series models outperform other models under 10 billion parameters such as CodeQwen1.5 7B and CodeGeex4 9B, and even achieve performance on par with DeepSeek-Coder 33B.
- **Extensive Training**: Yi-Coder-9B is trained on 2.4T tokens and builds on Yi-9B, while Yi-Coder-1.5B is trained from scratch on 3.1T tokens, plus the same 2.4T tokens. 
- **Various scenarios**: Yi-Coder series models are versatile in various tasks, such as basic and competitive programming, code editing and debugging, completion, and mathematical reasoning.

# News
ðŸ”¥ **2024-09-05**: The Yi-Coder model is open sourced and available to the public.

# Quick Start
## Requirements
To set up the environment and install the requirements, run the following command: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/01-ai/Yi-Coder.git
cd Yi-Coder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Transformers
You can use transformers to run inference with Yi-Coder models (both chat and base versions) as follows:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto
model_path = <Huggingface>

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map="auto").eval()

prompt = "Write a quick sort algorithm."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=1024,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id  
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```
## vllm
You can also use vLLM to reason about Yi-Coder models. vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for reasoning about and serving large language models (LLMs). Be sure to install vLLM and then do the following
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
model_path = <Huggingface>

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.8,
    top_p=0.8)

llm = LLM(model=model_path, 
          gpu_memory_utilization=0.9, 
          max_model_len=1024)

prompt = "Write a quick sort algorithm."  
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
print(text)

# Generate the response
outputs = llm.generate([text], sampling_params)

# Print the output
for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")

```
