# Introduction to Yi-Coder
**Yi-Coder series models** are trained for coding tasks and **outperform other models under 10 billion parameters** such as CodeQwen1.5 7B and CodeGeex4 9B, and even stay on par with DeepSeek-Coder 33B. 

Yi-Coder excels in long-context understanding, **handling up to 128K tokens** for project-level code comprehension and generation. It is versatile in tasks like programming, code editing, debugging, completion, and mathematical reasoning. 

Yi-Coder comes in 2 model sizes, 1.5B and 9B, supporting 52 coding languages. 

For model details and benchmarks, see Yi-Coder blog.

# News
ðŸ”¥ **2024-09-05**: The Yi-Coder series models are open sourced and available to the public.

# Quick Start
## Requirements
To set up the environment and install the requirements, run the following command: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/01-ai/Yi-Coder.git
cd Yi-Coder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Transformers
You can use transformers to run inference with Yi-Coder models (both chat and base versions) as follows:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto
model_path = <Huggingface>

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map="auto").eval()

prompt = "Write a quick sort algorithm."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=1024,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id  
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```
## vllm
You can also use vLLM to reason about Yi-Coder models. vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for reasoning about and serving large language models (LLMs). Be sure to install vLLM and then do the following
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
model_path = <Huggingface>

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.8,
    top_p=0.8)

llm = LLM(model=model_path, 
          gpu_memory_utilization=0.9, 
          max_model_len=1024)

prompt = "Write a quick sort algorithm."  
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
print(text)

# Generate the response
outputs = llm.generate([text], sampling_params)

# Print the output
for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")

```
